# tfhe stand for : Torus-Fully Homomorphic Encryption ou Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus
In this scheme one can encrypt messages like integers. So before encrypting a message we need to transform our message from "texts, images" etc to the corresponding integer [2].

The security of such a scheme is based on the Learning With Error which is called Quantum Resistant. The security depends on a distribution for keys and the small amount of noise we use to encrypt a message. It is said to be safe to use the Gaussian Distribution in instead of using others [1].
